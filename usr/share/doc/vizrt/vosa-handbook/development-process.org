* Development Process

The development process consists of a chain of processes and applications
working together to create an efficient and agile environment for change
management.  

** TODO Jira


** TODO Source code repository


** TODO The builder


** Development image

The main environment for change is the local development environment 
a.k.a. "dev image". The dev image is downloaded as a .ova file that 
can be imported into VirtualBox or VMWare Player. It works under 
Windows, OSX and Linux, and provides an Ubuntu image with Escenic 
Content Engine already installed with a publication and an .ear 
file from the project.

*** Download .ova file

Your dev image can be downloaded here - [[<%= trail_dev_image_uri %>][Local development environment]].

*** Import .ova file into VirtualBox

1) After you have downloaded the .ova file you can open the file in i.e. VirtualBox.

2) VirtualBox will recognize the format and offer you a dialog for importing the image.

3) After klicking "Import" you will be asked to agree to a license agreement and after clicking "Agree" the import process will start.

4) When the import finished the VirtualBox Manager will open and your image will be visible in a list. It's now time to adjust your settings. Unless you have very specific changes you would like to perform for memory, number of CPUs etc... opening the settings dialog and then click "OK" is enough to finish the initial configuration.

5) The next step will be to start the image. This is done by selecting the image in the list and then click "Start" in the VirtualBox Manager.

6) After the image has started up, you should be able to see its local IP address. This is the IP you need to add to the hosts file on your workstation/laptop.
