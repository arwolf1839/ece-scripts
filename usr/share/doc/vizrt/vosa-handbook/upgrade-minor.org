* Upgrading from Escenic *.x.* to *.y.* (minor version upgrade)
When an Escenic cluster needs to be upgraded we perform the following steps.
01. Make a branch in subversion of the escenic customer project.
02. Write a script to Upgrade the dev image db and mm (make available as deb package).
03. Change the root pom in the customer project to reflect the target version.
04. Make an ear and test it in the dev image.
05. Provide the tested dev image to the customer and point out the standard template upgrade issues.
06. Wait for template development to upgrade the templates.
07. Create a test server so the new stuff can be tried by editorial when the templates are ready.
08. Start an automatic copy and upgrade of the mm directory and the database.
09. Create a production platform with full redundancy but small scale that points to it.
