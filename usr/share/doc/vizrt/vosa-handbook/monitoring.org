* Monitoring

On a VOSA system you have several tools to aid you in getting an
overview of how your system is doing, how it is configured and how it
has been behaving from its inception till the present.

** system-info

*** On the Command Line
On any VOSA host, you can execute the command system-info. If you
execute this command as root, you better pass a parameter to tell it
the user under which ECE, EAE and the Search instance are running as
(typically "escenic"):

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# system-info -u escenic  
#+END_SRC

*** In the Web Browser
All VOSA hosts also has a (maximum) one minute old HTML report from
system-info running on port ~5678~. 

** Hugin
Hugin is an automatic, frequent aggregation of the system-info data of
all the hosts in your habitat. It does this by asking the hossts to
produce a system-info report in YAML and check the files into a
version repository.

When browsing the Hugin web interface at
http://<%= trail_control_host %><%= trail_network_name %>:5679/ you can quickly 
see all changes on the various servers. A change could be a new
service which is all of a sudden listening on a new port or that the
version of a installed package has changed. Nothing escapes Hugin's
watchful eyes!
 
** Munin
Each VOSA habitat has its own Munin installation where you can see the
trending of your site. I.e. how it has been behaving the last days,
weeks and months.

The address to your Munin instance is is:
 http://<%= trail_monitoring_host %><%= trail_network_name %>/munin/

** Icinga (enhanced Nagios)
Icinga gives a good overview of the current health of the
habitat. Head over to
 http://<%= trail_monitoring_host %><%= trail_network_name %>/icinga/ 
to get updates on host & service uptimes and disk fill rates. This is
also the place were you'll schedule any maintenance work you do to
prevent unnecessary alerts filling up your mobile phone and email
inboxes.
