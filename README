Note!
========
This version of ece-scripts is currently being modified to support java7, tomcat7 and content engine 5.6. During this transition the latest version of ece-scripts will not work correctly for previously released engine versions.


========
Overview
========
These are scripts to help template developers and administrators
manage various components of the Escenic Content Engine. The scripts
are experimental and not yet a part of the official distribution of
Escenic Content Engine from Vizrt Online.

========================
Project directory layout
========================
The file structure ressembles where you'd typically put the various
scripts and configuration files. That's all it is, only for
documentational purposes :-)
